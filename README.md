## About the Project
![Screenshot of the project](Screenshot.png)

Pig Game is a game browser developed by Jonas Schmedtmann in the Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). I wrote this code to learn basic techniques to know how to manipulate the DOM. Besides, this code will help to develop other web games or Web App's as a code reference.

The focusing part of this project is the use of JavaScript's **DOM** manipulation..

**Notes**
>The code is full of Spanish comments.
